# PowerShellToolbox

A simple way to have your PowerShell scripts and utilities all in one place!

![Demonstration](demo.webp)

Inspired by [dan-osull's PowerShell-Script-Menu-Gui](https://github.com/dan-osull/PowerShell-Script-Menu-Gui)

### Compatibility

This script has been tested with PowerShell 5.1 & 7.3.4, on Windows 11 and Windows Server 2022

## How does this work?

A simple XAML WPF user interface is automatically generated based on a JSON file. The best way to start is by modifying the existing `data.json` file.
